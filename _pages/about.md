My research passion lies in Explainable AI (XAI), where I act as a detective for AI decisions. Currently, I focus on model-agnostic, local explanation techniques—the universal keys to unlocking the black box. My latest adventure involves applying these methods to decipher the reasoning of large language models. I pursue this work as a graduate student at the School of Computer Science, Peking University, driven by the belief that for AI to be truly powerful, it must also be understandable.
