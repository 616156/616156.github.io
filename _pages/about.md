I'm a second year Ph.D. student from [Programming Languages Lab](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), on a quest to make artificial intelligence more transparent and trustworthy. My primary arsenal consists of model-agnostic, local explanation methods, allowing me to probe a wide range of AI models. Recently, I've turned this focus towards one of the most exciting frontiers: interpreting the complex inner workings of large language models, working to ensure that the future of AI is not just intelligent, but also intelligible.
